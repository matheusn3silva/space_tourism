## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

- I created the vue.js project and configured it.
- I started by creating the navigation bar, its style and features.
- Then I went to Home and created your style
- And I went to destination, then crew and finally technology. Creating your styles and interactions in that order.
- Finally, I made each component responsive to finish the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Pre-processors: Sass
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

I learned a lot on this project, as it was my first big project, and my first time using vue.js and typescript.

During development I had a lot of difficulties and even had to recreate some components such as ```Navbar``` and ```Crew```.

I also learned a lot about how to make a project very scalable and facilitate maintenance. Every line of code I wrote I kept thinking about how to make it as easy to understand and if one day I wanted to expand this project, make it as scalable as possible.

### Keep learning

- Router links: I tried to use router-links at the beginning, but I ended up having a lot of trouble adapting them to the project, and I used dynamic components instead.
That's why I intend to continue learning more about them and improving myself even more.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - Figma helps me a lot when building projects, it would probably have taken me much longer without it. And I intend to continue improving myself in this tool.
